# Android Malware Permissions Classification Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project examines the use of machine learning algorithms to classify Android applications as either benign or malware based on their permission requests. This study is motivated by the increasing prevalence of Android malware and the need for effective detection methods.

## Methodology
- **Data Sources:** Utilized the Vinaya dataset, encompassing various Android apps with labeled permissions.
- **ML Algorithms:** Employed Support Vector Machine (SVC) and Decision Tree methods.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Focused on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores to assess the performance of each model.

## Key Findings
- Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malware apps.
- The seemingly simpler algorithm of the Decision Tree model is as good if not slightly better in its predictive capabilities than the SVC model produced, with a speedier method and a lighter processing time overhead.

## Repository Contents
- `Data`: Folder containing the dataset and preprocessing scripts.
- `Scripts`: Source code for different machine learning models used in the project.
- `analysis`: Scripts for model evaluation and comparison, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score calculations.
