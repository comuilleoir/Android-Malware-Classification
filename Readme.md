# Android Malware Permissions Classification Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project explores the application of machine learning algorithms, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree models, in classifying Android applications as benign or malware based on their permission requests. This is crucial in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity, where efficient and accurate malware detection is essential.

## Methodology
- **Data Sources:** The project uses the Vinaya dataset, which includes a variety of Android applications with labeled permissions.
- **ML Algorithms:** Implements SVM and Decision Tree models. These models are chosen for their efficiency and effectiveness in classification tasks.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores are used to evaluate the models' performance.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Findings
- Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malware apps.
- The seemingly simpler algorithm of the Decision Tree model is as good if not slightly better in its predictive capabilities than the SVC model produced, with a speedier method and a lighter processing time overhead.

## Repository Contents
- `Data`: Contains the dataset and preprocessing scripts.
- `Scripts`: Includes the source code for the SVM and Decision Tree models.
- `Project Images`: Graphs and charts related to the analysis.
